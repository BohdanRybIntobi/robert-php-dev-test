PHP Architect Test for Robert

# Instructions:
1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch with your name for making changes.
3. Work on the tasks listed below.
4. Once done, create a pull request from your branch to the main repository.

# Tasks:
# Task 1: Design Patterns and Architecture

You are tasked with designing the architecture for a new Computer-Assisted Translation tool. Consider the following aspects:

* How would you structure the system to handle multilingual content efficiently?
* Discuss the design patterns you would implement to ensure scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.
* Propose a database schema to store and manage translation units.
* Briefly describe how you would implement version control for translations.

# Task 2: PHP Coding Challenge

Implement a basic PHP class for managing translation units. The class should have the following functionalities:

* Add a new translation unit.
* Retrieve a translation unit by ID.
* Update a translation unit and keep history.
* Delete a translation unit.

Please provide a simple usage example demonstrating these functionalities.

# Task 3: API Design

Design a simple RESTful API for the CAT tool. The API should allow users to perform CRUD operations on translation units. Include endpoints for listing all units, retrieving a specific unit, updating a unit, and deleting a unit.

# Task 4: Testing

Write unit tests for the PHP class you implemented in Task 2. Use a testing framework of your choice.
